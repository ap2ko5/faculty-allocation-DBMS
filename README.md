DBMS PROJECT FOR FACULTY ALLOCATION 
Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Project Title: Faculty-Class Allocation System
Prepared by: Arun Prabhasnakar, Aswathi M, Abel Abraham Panicker, Amala Jose
Course/Lab: Database Laboratory
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The Faculty-Class Allocation System is designed to simplify the allocation of teachers to
classes in a college environment. Currently, allocation is either done manually or through
spreadsheets, leading to inefficiency, unfair workload distribution, and potential scheduling
conflicts. This system aims to automate and streamline the allocation process, ensuring
fairness, transparency, and efficiency.
1.2 Scope
The system will:
Allow teachers to log in and select class/subject preferences.
Allow administrators to approve manual requests or trigger automatic allocation.
Assign teachers automatically based on workload limits, subject specialization, and
availability.
Prevent allocation conflicts (time clashes or overloads).
Generate reports showing teacher allocations.
1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations
Teacher: Faculty member
Admin: System administrator
Auto-allocation: Automatic assignment of teachers
DBMS: Database Management System
Load: Teaching hours or classes assigned
